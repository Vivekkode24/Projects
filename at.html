        <h1>Attck On Titan<br>進撃の巨人</h1>
        <h1>Opinion:</h1>
        <p>Attack on Titan is a Shounen action anime with a very unique plot and look to it.<br>
        The anime takes place in a made up world where human kind had to flee behind the 3 walls,<br>
        Maria, Rose and Sina, to survive from the titans that are terrorising them every<br>
        moment. The main characters, Eren, Mikasa and Armin, along with the supporting<br>
        characters have a very unique backstory and personality. The anime does not have any fillers<br>
        and every single episode captures the viewers attention and is crucial to understanding the<br>
        the some what complx story. Animation and music make it a lot more enjoyable and likable.<br>
        On my personal list it is ranked number 4.
